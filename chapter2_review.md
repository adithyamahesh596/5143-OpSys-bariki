## 1.What are the three objectives of an operating system design?

Convenience      : As ,operating system acts an interface between software and hardware ,it provides more ease to user to access the resources. For example, GUI in windows is user friendly

Efficiency       : The resources of a computer such as hardware and software resources can be efficiently used by an operating system.

Ability to evolve: An operating system should allow the effective development, testing, and introduction
	                 of new system functions  at the same time without interfering with service.


## 2.What is the kernel of an OS?

The Kernel is the very most important component of an operating system. The Kernel handles thread
scheduling, process switching, exception and interrupt handling, and multiprocessor
synchronization.The distinct characteristic of the kernel is that it's own code does not run in threads.


## 3.What is multiprogramming?

Multiprogramming is defined as the phenomenon of sharing the processor, when two or more piece of codes are residing in memory at the same time . Multiprogramming 
assumes a single shared processor. It increases CPU
utilization by organizing jobs so that the CPU always has one to execute.


## 4.What is a process?

A process is defined as an instance of a computer program that is being executed.It is more than a program code.
Basically, a run time program is called as process.


## 5.How is the execution context of a process used by the OS?

Execution context of a process is known as context switching.This mechanism allows the single process to handle numerous processes 
without the need of extra processors.It is maintained either by software or hardware depending on the architecture of the Operating System.



## 6.List and briefly explain five storage management responsibilities of a typical OS.

Process isolation:
The removal of data and instruction from colliding with another process makes this possible
Automatic allocation and management:
This is the strategy  in where the allocating method should be transparent to the coder.

Support of modular programming:
Supports the program to be able to define programs modules and to create, destroy and alter the size of modules dynamically.

Protection and access control:
This is the process of sharing memory  when sharing is needed by a particular application it also threatens the integrity of programs.

Long term storage:
Is a process whereby memory is stored for a long period of time even when the computer is switch off it is stored in the RAM.


## 7.Explain the distinction between a real address and a virtual address.

Real Address:
An address actually present on memory unit is called as real address/physical address.
Real address is provided directly by a machine. We have one physical address space per machine.
Real/Physical address space is divided into frames.
Virtual Address:
An address generated by CPU is called as virtual address. 
The user programs deals with the virtual address.
Virtual address is the address provided by the operating system to the processes. 
We have one virtual address space for process.
Virtual address space is divided into pages.

## 8.Describe the round-robin scheduling technique.

A round robin is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group equally in some rational order, usually from
the top to the bottom of a list and then starting again at the top of the list and so on.
A simple way to think of round robin is that it is about "taking turns." 


## 9.Explain the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel.

Monolithic kernel:
A  monolithic kernel  in which all pieces of the kernel are closely intertwined.
A monolithic kernel,  implements the drivers as a part of the kernel.
A Monolithic kernel is an OS architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space.
Monolithic kernels are able to dynamically load (and unload) executable modules at runtime.

Micro kernel:
A microkernal is a small operating system core that provides the foundation for modular extensions. 
It is a kernel implementing a minimal set of abstractions. Typically, higher-level OS services such as file systems
and device drivers are implemented in layers above a microkernel, possibly in trusted user-mode servers.
Some of the advantages are uniform interfaces, extensibility, flexibility, portability and reliability.
The microkernel is responsible for mapping each virtual page to a physical page frame.
The microkernel architecture is a better design principle and is ideal in critical situations where reliability
is of uttermost importance like military or aerospace industries.


## 10.What is multithreading?

Multithreading is the ability of an operating system to concurrently run programs that have been divided into subcomponents, or threads.
Multithreading, when done correctly, offers better utilization of processors and other system resources.
Multithreaded programming requires a multitasking/ multithreading operating system, 
capable of running many programs concurrently.


## 11.List the key design issues for an SMP operating system.

Simultaneous concurrent processesScheduling
Synchronization
Memory Management
Reliability and Fault Tolerance
